### 4 (or 8) tracks Mixer (Bank 2)

**NOTE**: the 8-track mode will require _2 MF-Twister modules_

Use `dual twister mode` to have 8 track pages, if you have 2 MFTs.
(in this mode, bank buttons are moved to the left, for your convenience so you can have your
MFTs side-to-side :smile:)

Use `Extender` in settings to set specific MFT as a '2nd page'. When set in this mode, MFT will
control tracks which numbers are in parens.
(When in extender mode, bank buttons stays to the right, so you can have them side-by-side)

| Knob | Twist                    | Click                     | Hold & Twist     | Long Press       | RGB Light                        |
| ---- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------- |

| 5-8  | Send 2 track 1-4 (5-8)   | Arm                       |  -               | -                | Follow send color & arm status   |
| 9-12 | Send 3 track 1-4 (5-8)   | Solo (Enter in a group)   |  -               | Exit group       | Follow send color & solo status  |
| 13-16| Track volume 1-4 (5-8)   | Mute                      |  Pan             | -                | Follow track color & mute status |
| 3    | ...                      | Previous 8-track page     |  -               | -                | -                                |
| 4    | ...                      | Next 8-track page         |  -               | -                | -                                |

No further pages are planned here, if you get n-pages to work, please open an issue. :smile:

#### dual twister mode

- enable dual mode for 8-track pages
- set a second twister in dual mode + extender to get 4-8 tracks' control
- in extender mode, bank buttons are on the right

When switching mode, you need to restart the extensions in order to process the config change

#### two single mode twister

This will behave poorly as both twisters will bind to the first 4-tracks

### Eq Mode (Bank 3)

If you check `Enable EQ 3rd band`, the 3rd bank become the closest EQ+ controller.

| Knob | Twist                 | Hold & Twist     | Double-click     | RGB Light               |
| ---- | --------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| 1-4  | Band 1-4 frequency    |  Band 1-4 Q      | Mute band        | Freq color & mute:off   |
| 5-8  | Band 1-4 gain         |  Band 1-4 Type   | Turn band off    | Freq color & OFF:Off    |
| 9-12 | Band 5-8 frequency    |  Band 5-8 Q      | Mute band        | Freq color & mute:off   |
| 13-16| Band 5-8 gain         |  Band 5-8 Type   | Turn band off    | Freq color & OFF:Off    |

If disabled, bank 3 is a User-mappable bank.

### Specific Device Mode (Bank 3 or 4)

This will be the 4th bank if EQ is enabled, 3rd otherwise.

If you check `Specific device`, the knobs will map to what's set in your Specific-Device toml file.
Please refer to [Specific device section](#specific-device-settings) to set it up.

| Knob | Twist                 | Hold & Twist     | Double-click     | RGB Light               |
| ---- | --------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| 1-16 | Value                 |  -               | Reset value      | User & off:unmapped     |

#### Notes

- If a device or parameter does not exist in the current context then the corresponding lights will
  be off.

- See the section on [specific device settings](#Specific-Device-Settings) for information on
  configuring knobs 7 and 8.

- To activate the shift actions hold the "shift" side button.

- See the section on [pinned indication](#pinned-indication) for information on how track and device
  pinned state is indicated by the RGB LEDs.

### User Mappable Bank (Bank (3-4))

Those knobs pages are taken over by EQ and Specific Device assign.
MFT will handle "only" 4 banks.

| Knob | Twist               | Hold & Twist               | Double Click      | RGB Light        |
| ---- | ------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| 1-16 | Mapped parameter(s) | Set light color (see bugs) | Reset light color | currently broken |

| Side Button  | Action        |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| Left Side 1  | -             |
| Left Side 2  | -             |
| Left Side 3  | -             |
| Right Side 1 | Previous bank |
| Right Side 2 | Next bank     |
| Right Side 3 | Go to bank 1  |

#### Bugs

the per-project settings are broken in a strange way, probably on bitwig side, which breaks knobs
color settings (only in user mapping banks, the rest is working as expected).

## Options

These are global options that apply to the specific device across all projects. They are accessed in
the controller settings in the Bitwig Studio dashboard.

![options](images/options.png)

### Show Bank Popup

Enable/disable showing a popup notification when banks are changed.

### Device Row Color

Sets the color used for knobs 5-8 in the [track & device bank](#Track-&-Device-Bank-(Bank-1)). This
uses the same color values as the [user mappable knobs](#User-Mappable-Knob-Colors).

### Global Fine Sensitivity

Sets the fine sensitivity factor for all encoder controls. The lower the number, the finer the
movement.

### Pinned Indication

Sets the light animation that will be used to indicate when a track or device is pinned. These
animations are described in the twister user manual.

When a track or device is pinned, the MIDI Fighter Twister will not follow the current track or device selected with the mouse or another controller. Info about the state of a pinned track or device is available in the Studio I/O panel in Bitwig Studio.

### Enable EQ

Enable EQ control for 3rd bank instead of user mappings.

EQ controls are described above, it will attach to the last EQ+ on currently selected track.

### Enable Specific device 

Enable specific devices for 3rd (or 4th) bank instead of user mappings.

### Dual twister mode

Control pages of 8 track in the mixer instead of 4.

### Extender

Swap bank button. Offset 4 track faders control by 4. In dual twister mode, this is how you specify
Which is on the left and which is on the right.

tl;dr - Right-hand MFT when using 2.

## Project Settings

These are per project settings and will be saved with each project. They are accessed in the I/O
panel of Bitwig Studio.

![project-settings](images/project-settings.png)

### User Mappable Knob Colors

Show or hide the settings for each bank using the bank selector. Each knob can have it's color set
to one of the 125¹ colors supported by the Twister. A value of 0 will turn the light off.

These settings can also be changed by holding and twisting any of the user mappable knobs.

_¹ This should be 126 colors but there is a
[bug](https://github.com/DJ-TechTools/Midi_Fighter_Twister_Open_Source/issues/9) in the latest
software._

## Specific Device Settings

The specific device feature allows you to assign two device specific parameters to knobs 7 and 8 in
the [track & device bank](#Track-&-Device-Bank-(Bank-1)). These follow the selected device.

The settings file `SpecificDeviceSettings.toml` allows you to configure which parameters for which
devices will be assigned. The file is in [TOML](https://toml.io) format.

### Devices

Devices are added to the settings file into one of three table arrays.

- `bitwig` for Bitwig Studio devices
- `vst3` for VST3 devices
- `vst2` for VST2 devices

Each table in the array consists of an `id` key and a `params` table that contains any number of
parameter ID keys. The type of the ID and parameters is different for each of the three types.

| Device Type | ID Type     | Parameter Type |
| ----------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| Bitwig      | UUID String | String         |
| VST3        | String      | Integer        |
| VST2        | Integer     | Integer        |

See the included `SpecificDeviceSettings.toml` file for examples.

### Controls

The `controls` table contains two string arrays, `knob1` and `knob2`. The strings in these arrays
are the device parameter key names that will be assigned to the respective knob in the
[track & device bank](#Track-&-Device-Bank-(Bank-1)).

For example, inserting the string `"mix"` into the array will assign any parameters defined with a
key `mix` to that knob.

See the included `SpecificDeviceSettings.toml` file for examples.

### Finding IDs

In order to retreive IDs for devices and their parameters you must add a configuration option to
Bitwig Studio.

1. Create a file with the name `config.json` in your user settings directory. The location of this
   directory is platform dependent:

    - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%/Bitwig Studio`
    - Mac:     `Library/Application Support/Bitwig/Bitwig Studio`
    - Linux:   `~/.BitwigStudio`

2. Add the following line to the `config.json` file: `can-copy-device-and-param-ids: true`

3. Restart Bitwig Studio

Once you have this setting in place, you can retreive IDs from the context menu of the device and
parameters.
