# Fork considerations

This is twister sister, with those mods:

- replace user controls and pan knob with more sends
- add bank2 , controlling 4 consecutive tracks (faders on 4th row), and 3 sends (3 first rows)
    - move banks button to the left side by default
    - toggle arm - click send2 knob
    - toggle solo - click send3 knob
    - toggle mute - click volume knob
    - pan - click + volume
- add a toggle to set a MFT as an "extender", when a track has this option enabled:
    - banks button are on the right side
    - track controls (banks) are offset by 4 tracks (you get an 8 fader page)
- Bank2/knob4 (top-right): click = next fader page
- Bank2/knob3 (top-right): click = previous fader page
- Bank2/knob3-4 (top-right): long-click = get in/out group

- Bank 3 can be a EQ+ control
- Bank 3 (4, if EQ is enabled) can be the specific Devices setting

The fork brings in a bunch of settings, but they need the extension to be reset! Use the power
button in extension setting to restart it when enabling/disabling banks.

## Eq Mode

If you check `Enable EQ 3rd band`, the 3rd bank become the closest EQ+ controller.

- Bank3/knob on 1st and 3rd row:
    - twist = set frequency
    - click + twist = set Q
    - double-click = mute band (freq led turn off)
- bank3/knob on 2nd and 4th row:
    - twist = set gain
    - click + twist = set filter type
    - double-click = turn band off (re-enable by setting a filter type)
- RGB under knob matches Bitwig' :rainbow: frequency display

## Specific controller mode

Basically the 2 specific device knob from dozius, but they're 16, on a dedicated bank.

(map'em with the toml file :) )

## dual twister mode

- enable dual mode for 8-track pages
- set a second twister in dual mode + extender to get 4-8 tracks' control
- in extender mode, bank buttons are on the right

When switching mode, you need to restart the extensions in order to process the config change

## two single mode twister

This will behave poorly as both twisters will bind to the first 4-tracks, but with pins,
this might work for you just fine.

## more twisters

hack it yourself.

## issues

- behaves poorly when tracks are pinned
- per-project user mapping don't save their color (since bw5.0.0)
